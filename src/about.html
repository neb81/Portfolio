                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Through my professional life, I have worked in various industries, always in search of my calling in life. However, in the back of my mind, I only ever had one dream that one day I would work in the tech industry. Recently I have decided to fulfil my dream. That has led me to sign up for Coder Academy Brisbane to get a diploma in Information Technology and kick off my career as a developer.</p>

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>When time permits, I like to relax by playing video games. I first started playing games in the '80s when my parents got me an Atari console. Gaming and Sci-Fi had a significant influence on me. Through it, I developed a passion for technology. My favourite type of games are strategy, and Stellaris tops that list.</p>
